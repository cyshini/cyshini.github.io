        <h2 class="title--m">We embarked on an exciting journey to remodel Interdrinks' versatile platform, designed to serve both logistics and office teams. Our goal: to make it exceptionally user-friendly and adaptable, catering to any device or context.</h2>
        <p class="text--l">Interdrinks, a dynamic online beer retailer, previously relied on a patchwork of in-house tools to handle inventory, order preparation, customer service, procurement, and financial tracking, among other things. But the user experience left much to be desired, burdened by outdated front-end technologies.</p>
        <p class="text--l">In just a few short weeks, armed with a thoughtfully reimagined UI kit and a fresh, custom identity, I teamed up directly with the end-users. Through interviews and rigorous testing, we breathed new life into the platform, resulting in a comprehensive redesign. The outcome? A centralized, responsive platform that's not only a breeze for newcomers but also a joy for seasoned users. It seamlessly adapts to every environment, whether it's the buzzing energy of a warehouse or the cozy confines of an office.</p>
